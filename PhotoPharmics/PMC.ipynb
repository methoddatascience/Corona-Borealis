We optimized the immobilization conditions by varying the support pore size, the immobilization buffer and its pH. Maximum loading and maximum activity were achieved at different pHs (4.0 and 6.0 respectively). Selectivity, shown by the transesterification/hydrolysis products molar ratio, varied more than 3-fold depending on the reaction buffer used and its pH. Under all conditions studied, hydrolysis was the dominant activity of the enzyme. pH and water content had the greatest influence on the enzyme selectivity and activity. Determined kinetic parameters of the enzyme were obtained and\\xa0showed that K<sub>m</sub> was not affected by the immobilization but k<sub>cat</sub> was reduced 10-fold when comparing the free and immobilized enzymes. Thermal and pH stabilities as well as the reusability were investigated. The immobilized biocatalyst retained more than 20% of its activity after ten cycles of transesterification reaction.</p>\\n</sec>\\n<sec>\\n<title>Conclusions</title>\\n<p id=\"Par3\">These results indicate that this enzyme is more suited for hydrolysis reactions than transesterification despite good reusability.

One strategy used to solve this problem is to immobilize the enzymes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR1\">1</xref>]. Immobilized enzymes can exhibit enhanced properties in terms of activity, specificity or selectivity. The proposed mechanisms behind those apparent alterations have been reviewed recently [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>]. Enzymes can be immobilized using different techniques such as encapsulation, enzyme cross linking or immobilization on a solid support by physical adsorption or covalent linkages which have been reviewed recently [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR3\">3</xref>]. In this study, immobilization relied on physical adsorption.</p>\\n<p id=\"Par16\">Materials made of mesoporous silica (MPS) have recently become interesting as support materials for immobilized enzymes. MPS offers unique properties such as high surface area and tunable pore size over the range 2\\u201350\\xa0nm [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref>]. They also have high chemical and mechanical stability [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR5\">5</xref>]. Among the variety of existing MPS materials, SBA-15 (Santa Barbara Amorphous Type 15) present some interesting properties. SBA-15 has a well ordered network of hexagonal silica structures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>] of which the pore size and thickness of the walls can be tuned by varying the synthesis conditions. Both pore size and wall thickness are uniform throughout the material. Different kinds of enzymes, such as feruloyl esterases, lipases, glucose oxidases and papain, have been successfully immobilized in this type of mesoporous support [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>\\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR9\">9</xref>]. It has also been shown that immobilization can increase the enzyme stability, increasing its half-life by more than 60,000 times in some cases [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR10\">10</xref>]. Furthermore, enzyme immobilization can modify the specific activity of the enzyme or even change its selectivity and specificity in synthetic reactions, almost doubling the final product yield [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>]. These findings are promising, and indicate that it could be possible to tune the activity of an enzyme simply by immobilizing it in a particular way. Moreover, SBA-15 can provide a sheltered environment for the enzymes, as is the case with other porous materials. It has been suggested that the porous network in which the enzymes are immobilized can create concentration gradients (pH, solvent, substrate, etc.), thereby having a positive effect on the biocatalyst [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>]. The properties of MPS thus make it an attractive immobilization support.</p>\\n<p id=\"Par17\">Feruloyl esterases (FAEs), also known as ferulic acid esterases, cinnamoyl esterases or cinnamoyl ester hydrolases, are enzymes belonging to a subclass of carboxylic ester hydrolases (E.C. 3.1.1.73). In nature, these enzymes catalyze the hydrolysis of ester linkages, releasing ferulic acid (FA) and other hydroxycinnamic acids from plant cell wall material. FAEs are of particular importance in the degradation of plant cell walls where they have been shown to act synergistically with other carbohydrate-degrading enzymes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR12\">12</xref>]. FAEs have found applications in many industrial sectors such as the pulp and paper industry, bioethanol production and the feed industry [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>].</p>\\n<p id=\"Par18\">Other sectors in which applications are found for FAEs are the cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>], as FAEs are able to release FA and other hydroxycinnamic acids, which have been reported to have antitumor, antimicrobial and/or antioxidant effects [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR14\">14</xref>]. FAEs can also catalyze the synthesis of various hydroxycinnamic acids through esterification and transesterification reactions [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR15\">15</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR16\">16</xref>]. As with other synthetic reactions, transesterification reactions are more likely to occur when the water content of the reaction medium is low. Reducing the water content decreases the water activity in the reaction system, thereby promoting synthetic reactions, and allowing hydrolytic enzymes to act as biosynthetic tools [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR17\">17</xref>\\u2013<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR19\">19</xref>]. Being able to synthesize and tune the properties of hydroxycinnamic acids through transesterification would be valuable in expanding their applicability. Modification of hydroxycinnamic acids to alter their solubility or hydrophobicity, may be necessary prior to their use in cosmetic or pharmaceutical products, for formulation purposes. These modifications are difficult using traditional chemistry [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR13\">13</xref>]. The development of enzymatic synthesis tools is thus both attractive and promising.</p>\\n<p id=\"Par19\">The objective of this study was to gain insight into how the immobilization of a commercially available FAE, E-FAERU, derived from a rumen microorganism, in MPS by physical adsorption affects the enzyme and its selectivity. The substrates used in the reactions were methyl ferulate (MFA) and 1-butanol. Parameters such as pH, buffer and water content were varied during immobilization to assess their impact on immobilization efficiency and on enzyme selectivity. Another aim of the study was to evaluate the effects of immobilization on the kinetic parameters of the FAE. We first identified the optimum reaction conditions, and then determined the kinetic parameters K<sub>m</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub> using the model substrate MFA. Finally, the industrial potential of the enzyme was investigated by evaluating its stability and reusability.</p>\\n</sec>\\n<sec id=\"Sec2\">\\n<title>Methods</title>\\n<sec id=\"Sec3\">\\n<title>Chemicals and enzyme</title>\\n<p id=\"Par20\">Ferulic acid and methyl ferulate were purchased from Apin Chemicals Ltd.

SBA-15 MPS with three different pore sizes were synthesized using protocols adapted from Zhao et al. [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR6\">6</xref>] Pluronic P123 is used as structure directing agent and TEOS as the silica source. 4.0\\xa0g of P123 was dissolved in 120\\xa0g of 2\\xa0M HCl and 30\\xa0g of deionized water and the mixture was vigorously stirred for 2\\xa0h at 35\\xa0\\xb0C. 8.5\\xa0g of TEOS was added and the solution was stirred at 35\\xa0\\xb0C for an additional 24\\xa0h. The gel mixture was transferred to stainless steel pressure autoclaves with Teflon containers and was aged for 24\\xa0h at 80, 120 or 140\\xa0\\xb0C, depending on the desired pore diameter. The solid precipitate was recovered by vacuum filtration, washed with deionized water and dried. Finally, the template was removed from the product through calcination, by increasing the temperature from room temperature to 500\\xa0\\xb0C during 8\\xa0h followed by heating at 500\\xa0\\xb0C for another 6\\xa0h.

[<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>]. Briefly, the enzyme solution was spin-filtered (Amicon Ultra\\u20130.5\\xa0mL 10\\xa0K ultracel membrane, Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts, USA) with the same buffers as those used during immobilization (0.2\\xa0M phosphate-citrate in the pH range 4.0\\u20138.0, or 0.1\\xa0M MOPS in the pH range 6.0\\u20137.5, or 0.1\\xa0M Bis-Tris in the pH range 6.0\\u20137.5). The MPS was washed with immobilization buffer to remove possible residues from material preparation. To evaluate the effect of the immobilization buffer, the enzyme solution was mixed with 2\\xa0mg MPS (0.2 mg<sub>enz</sub> \\u22c5 mL<sub>buffer</sub><sup>\\u2212\\u20091</sup> and 44 mL<sub>buffer</sub> \\u22c5 g<sub>MPS</sub><sup>\\u2212\\u20091</sup>). For activity assays, the enzyme solution was mixed with 20\\xa0mg washed MPS (0.4 mg<sub>enz</sub> \\u22c5 mL<sub>buffer</sub><sup>\\u2212\\u20091</sup> and 44 mL<sub>buffer</sub> \\u22c5 g<sub>MPS</sub><sup>\\u2212\\u20091</sup>). Then left on a rotating wheel (Rotator SB3, Stuart, Stone, Staffordshire, UK) overnight at 40\\xa0rpm and room temperature (RT) in a micro-centrifuge tube. Immobilization was stopped by centrifugation (5\\xa0min, 15,000 \\xd7 g, RT) and the MPS carrying enzymes was washed 3 times with the immobilization buffer to remove unbound enzyme. The MPS was then dried in a vacuum concentrator (RVC 2\\u201318, Christ, Osterode am Harz, Germany) to remove residual water before activity tests were performed.</p>\\n</sec>\\n<sec id=\"Sec6\">\\n<title>Loading experiments</title>\\n<p id=\"Par23\">Loading experiments were performed according to the protocol described previously by varying the enzyme concentration from 0.1 to 1 mg<sub>enz</sub> \\u22c5 mL<sub>buffer</sub><sup>\\u2212\\u20091</sup>. The chosen buffer for the experiments was 0.2\\xa0M phosphate-citrate pH\\xa06.5. The experiments were done in triplicates.</p>\\n</sec>\\n<sec id=\"Sec7\">\\n<title>Determination of adsorption yields and enzyme loading</title>\\n<p id=\"Par24\">The amount of immobilized enzyme was calculated by measuring the amount of residual enzyme in the supernatants after the immobilization process, and in the subsequent washing buffer, using the Biorad DC protein assay kit with bovine serum albumin (BSA) as a standard (Biorad, Hercules, California, USA). The enzyme loading was then calculated as the quantity of adsorbed enzyme per mg MPS.</p>\\n</sec>\\n<sec id=\"Sec8\">\\n<title>Enzymatic assays</title>\\n<p id=\"Par25\">All enzymatic assays were performed using MFA as the substrate. In the buffer-butanol mixture used during the transesterification reactions, MFA can be converted to either FA via hydrolysis or BFA via transesterification (see reaction scheme in Fig.\\xa0<xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig1\">1</xref>). Two different types of assay were performed. A spectrophotometric assay when hydrolysis was studied, allowing the detection of MFA and FA; An HPLC measurement when studying transesterification allowing the detection of MFA, FA and BFA. All assays were performed in triplicate. For hydrolysis experiments, corresponding triplicate blanks were made using buffer (the same buffer and pH as in the reaction) instead of the enzyme and the activity of the enzyme was corrected by the background. The transesterification reaction was performed without adding enzyme and monitored during 48\\xa0h. Results showed no difference whether or not MPS were added to the reaction mixture with no detectable conversion of MFA into BFA or FA. Moreover, the MFA concentration remained the same during the time course of the experiment. Consequently, MPS did not as such contribute to the conversion of MFA and addition of enzyme greatly accelerated the reaction towards its thermodynamic equilibrium.<fig id=\"Fig1\"><label>Fig. 1</label><caption><p>Reaction scheme of feruloyl esterase catalysis in a buffer-butanol mixture where both transesterification reaction converting methyl ferulate (MFA) to butyl ferulate (BFA) and hydrolysis reaction converting MFA to ferulic acid (FA) take place</p></caption><graphic id=\"MO1\" xlink:href=\"12858_2018_91_Fig1_HTML\"></graphic></fig></p>\\n</sec>\\n<sec id=\"Sec9\">\\n<title>Hydrolysis reactions</title>\\n<p id=\"Par26\">Hydrolysis reactions were performed in buffer using a 0.5\\xa0mM MFA stock solution. MFA was prepared by dissolving the powder first in methanol (5% (<italic>v</italic>/v)) and then in the buffer (95% (v/v)). For the free enzyme, 900\\xa0\\u03bcL of the substrate stock solution was pre-incubated at 40\\xa0\\xb0C, and the reaction was started by the addition of 300\\xa0\\u03bcL of 5000-fold diluted enzyme in the chosen buffer. For the immobilized enzyme, 0.5\\xa0mg MPS carrying the enzyme was resuspended in 300\\xa0\\u03bcL buffer.

Transesterification reactions were monitored from the moment the product became detectable (14\\xa0h of reaction) until 22\\xa0h of reaction. During this time frame, all reactions showed a linear increase of the products which is characteristic of initial rates and therefore the thermodynamic equilibrium was not reached.

When using Bis-Tris buffer the FAE showed activity only at immobilization pH of 6.5 and 7.0, and with MOPS buffer an increasing BFA/FA ratio was observed with increasing pH, showing a maximum of 0.2 at pH\\xa07.5.

The latter value differed by one pH unit from the supplier\\u2019s data (Megazyme, optimum pH at 6.5 for hydrolysis of ethyl ferulate in 100\\xa0mM sodium phosphate buffer). However, since the present experiment was performed using a different substrate and buffer, the values are not directly comparable. Moreover, it has previously been reported that the optimum pH can vary by up to 1 pH unit depending on the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR25\">25</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR26\">26</xref>].

However, the observed profiles for immobilized enzyme were broader, leading to better relative activities at higher temperatures. Hence, the immobilized enzyme appears to be more stable as it retains more than 60% of its activity after incubation at 60\\xa0\\xb0C for 10\\xa0min, while the free enzyme retains less than 25%. The addition of 1-butanol to the mixture, required for the transesterification reaction, caused a decrease in the temperature optima for both the free and the immobilized enzyme of 25\\xa0\\xb0C and 10\\xa0\\xb0C, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig5\">5b</xref>).</p>\\n</sec>\\n<sec id=\"Sec24\">\\n<title>Kinetic parameters of the immobilized biocatalyst</title>\\n<p id=\"Par47\">In order to assess the effects of immobilization on the enzyme behavior, the kinetic parameters (V<sub>m</sub>, K<sub>m</sub> and k<sub>cat</sub>) were determined based on the Michaelis-Menten eq.

However, since the 1-butanol content of the reaction was not varied during the reaction, and 1-butanol was always present in excess, the kinetics for a single-substrate reaction deemed applicable.

The maximum decrease in the turnover number, k<sub>cat</sub>, of the enzyme upon immobilization was 10-fold. Furthermore, a 100-fold lower turnover number was observed in transesterification than in hydrolysis, for both the free and the immobilized enzyme. The resulting catalytic efficiency, k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub>, of the enzyme was therefore lower when the enzyme was immobilized than its free counterpart: up to 11-fold lower.

Since the pH optima were similar for the free and immobilized enzyme (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig5\">5a</xref>) similar behavior could be expected in long term stability (24\\xa0h). However, the free enzyme was more stable at all pH values investigated than the immobilized enzyme (Additional file <xref ref-type=\"media\" rid=\"MOESM1\">1</xref> Figure S2).

Influence of the pH of the immobilization buffer on the enzyme loading [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR24\">24</xref>] and selectivity [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>], has been investigated previously for FoFaeC, resulting in an increase of selectivity for transesterification. In another study, using four different FAEs from the thermophilic fungus <italic>Myceliophtora thermophila</italic> C1 and 10.1\\xa0nm pore size SBA-15, the selectivity towards transesterification was decreased for three out of four enzymes [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR28\">28</xref>]. In the present study, using a commercial FAE, immobilization led to a decreased selectivity for transesterification (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2c</xref>). Our findings therefore confirm the hypothesis that the selectivity of an enzyme can be changed by immobilization.</p>\\n<p id=\"Par53\">The best loading obtained in the present study (0.036\\xa0mg \\u22c5 mg<sup>\\u2212\\u20091</sup>) (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2b</xref>) was in the same range as the one obtained for a horseradish peroxidase (lower than 0.03\\xa0mg \\u22c5 mg<sup>\\u2212\\u20091</sup>) [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR29\">29</xref>]. However, it was lower than those achieved on SBA-15 for some other enzymes, which ranged from 0.044 to 0.185\\xa0mg \\u22c5 mg<sup>\\u2212\\u20091</sup> for a lipase, a glucose oxidase and papain [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR8\">8</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR9\">9</xref>]. Low loading can be explained by the low enzyme concentration used in the present study. This was further exemplified by the loading capacity experiment presented in Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig2\">2b</xref> where it was demonstrated that the maximum loading was not reached.</p>\\n<p id=\"Par54\">When looking at the immobilization in different pore size materials (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab2\">2</xref>), no difference in loading was observed. This finding supports the hypothesis that the FAE, (which diameter was estimated to be around 4\\xa0nm based on its molecular weight of 29\\xa0kDa and assuming that it is perfectly spherical) can enter the pores equally well in all the materials investigated. A lower specific activity was though observed for the material with the smaller pore size. This could be due to limitations on the diffusion of the substrate in the 5\\xa0nm pores since the estimated diameter of the enzyme is around 4\\xa0nm. Another possible explanation is increased rigidity of the enzyme due to more attachment points with the support, since the size of the enzyme is expected to be only slightly smaller than the size of the pores. There may also be some loss of activity due to enzyme orientation with its active site facing the walls, thus preventing the substrate from entering the enzyme active site.</p>\\n<p id=\"Par55\">Changing the pH of the reaction mixture may result in a change in the charge distribution of the amino acid residues of the enzyme, inducing slight modifications in their conformation, as well as in the way in which the enzyme interacts with its immobilization support [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR23\">23</xref>]. Such changes in enzyme conformation could explain the shift in selectivity observed when changing the reaction pH (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig3\">3</xref>). The best selectivity ratio was obtained at a reaction pH of 6.5 and 6.0 for the free and immobilized enzyme, respectively (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig3\">3a</xref>). However, a low reaction pH is not necessarily suitable in an industrial application as the specific activity of the enzyme is not optimal at low pH as demonstrated by the specific activities (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig3\">3b</xref>) which in this case were lower at pH\\xa06.0 than at pH\\xa07.0. A compromise must thus be made between enzyme selectivity and enzyme specific activity.</p>\\n</sec>\\n<sec id=\"Sec28\">\\n<title>Immobilization did not lead to changed substrate affinity</title>\\n<p id=\"Par56\">A biochemical characterization of the enzyme was performed in four different reaction systems: (i) free enzyme \\u2013 hydrolysis reaction, (ii) free enzyme \\u2013 transesterifications reaction, (iii) immobilized enzyme \\u2013 hydrolysis reaction and (iv) immobilized enzyme \\u2013 transesterification reaction. The optimum pH and temperature of the enzyme were investigated first. The free enzyme optimum pH was found to be 7.5 (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig5\">5a</xref>). When looking at the immobilized enzyme, optimum pH decreased to 7.0. A shift in pH optimum upon immobilization has been reported previously for another FAE [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR7\">7</xref>], and could be explained by the different microenvironment inside the pores of mesoporous materials [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR4\">4</xref>].</p>\\n<p id=\"Par57\">The optimum temperature of the free and immobilized enzymes studied in transesterification were decreased compared with the enzymes studied in hydrolysis (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig5\">5b</xref>). When the enzyme was free, a 15\\xa0\\xb0C decrease was observed. When it was immobilized the decrease was of 10\\xa0\\xb0C. This points to the fact that 1-butanol has a negative effect on the thermostability of the enzyme which is consistent with the fact that enzymes usually exhibit lower activities in organic solvents than in aqueous systems due to partial or complete denaturation of the enzyme [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR30\">30</xref>]. The observed decrease in the temperature optima for the immobilized enzyme was less dramatic. Together with the broader profiles observed, this may indicate that enzyme immobilization had a thermo-stabilizing effect, and a possible sheltering effect of the MPS pore system. The stabilizing effect of immobilization has been reported for other enzymes, and could be due to reduced flexibility of the enzyme due to attachment to the support, thus preventing thermal denaturation and reducing the negative effect of solvents such as 1-butanol which are known to destabilize protein structures [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR11\">11</xref>].</p>\\n<p id=\"Par58\">Upon immobilization, K<sub>m</sub> did not change, however, k<sub>cat</sub> was decreased (Table <xref ref-type=\"table\" rid=\"Tab3\">3</xref>); suggesting that there were no limitations on diffusion or mass transfer with the pore diameter used in these experiments (9.9\\xa0nm). It can therefore be concluded that immobilization reduced the reaction rate of the enzyme. Changes in kinetic parameters have been observed previously in other immobilized enzymes. A tendency towards positive effects has been seen in the case of lipases, with almost a doubling of the maximal velocity, V<sub>m</sub> [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR31\">31</xref>, <xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR32\">32</xref>], while negative effects have been reported for 2,3-dihydroxybiphenyl 1,2-dioxygenase immobilized on SBA-15, for which K<sub>m</sub> increased 2.8 times and k<sub>cat</sub> decreased nearly 4-fold [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR33\">33</xref>].</p>\\n</sec>\\n<sec id=\"Sec29\">\\n<title>Stability and reusability</title>\\n<p id=\"Par59\">It was clear that immobilization did not have a long-term stabilizing effect. It is known that physical adsorption is not the best strategy for improving the stability of an enzyme [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>]. However, for this enzyme it was observed no improvement in long-term stability due to immobilization but also minimal effects of immobilization on the optimal reaction conditions as well as minimal effects of immobilization on the enzyme selectivity. Taken together, these results suggest a naturally high rigidity of the enzyme, at least in the area around its active site [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR2\">2</xref>].</p>\\n<p id=\"Par60\">Looking into the reusability of the immobilized biocatalyst in transesterification, over ten cycles of 48\\xa0h, a shift in selectivity towards hydrolysis was observed (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig6\">6</xref>). Despite that, the immobilized enzymes retained 26% and 44% of their transesterification and hydrolysis relative activities, respectively, at the end of the experiment. Considering the harsh conditions (92.5% butanol) in which the enzymes were put, the retained activities can be considered good. However, it is likely that no gain in terms of the total amount of BFA produced would be obtained by immobilizing this enzyme on this type of support, since the transesterification activity of the free enzyme was higher than the one of the immobilized enzyme (Fig. <xref ref-type=\"fig\" rid=\"Fig3\">3b</xref>). In the present study, enzymes immobilized on MPS were dried before being used in transesterification reactions. One way to improve the BFA yield of immobilized enzymes might be to replace the drying step by solvent rinsing as it has been shown to improve the productivity of a FAE from <italic>Myceliophtora thermophila</italic> C1 from 3 to 5 mmol<sub>BFA</sub>/g<sub>enz</sub>/h [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR28\">28</xref>].</p>\\n<p id=\"Par61\">Because of its inherently good stability, this enzyme has some potential to become a good immobilized biocatalyst. But more work is needed to find the appropriate support and/or immobilization technique. It has also been shown that the solvent-buffer system used influences the reaction rate [<xref ref-type=\"bibr\" rid=\"CR34\">34</xref>], which could also offer means of improving the enzyme performance. Among the parameters investigated, the water content and the pH of the buffer, during both immobilization and reaction, proved to be critical in improving the transesterification ratio.</p>\\n</sec>\\n</sec>\\n<sec id=\"Sec30\">\\n<title>Conclusions</title>\\n<p id=\"Par62\">Immobilizing the FAE: E-FAERU resulted in a lowered transesterification efficiency. In earlier studies, changes of selectivity have also been observed upon immobilization of FAEs on SBA-15. Overall, regarding the selectivity of E-FAERU, the hydrolysis reaction was preferred by the enzyme regardless if it was free or immobilized. The long-term stability of the immobilized FAE was improved at 55\\xa0\\xb0C, whereas no improvement was observed under other conditions. However, improvements in short-term stability of more than 2-fold were obtained when defining the temperature profile. Under optimized immobilization and reaction conditions it was demonstrated that immobilization did not affect the K<sub>m</sub> of the studied FAE. However, the turnover number, k<sub>cat</sub>, decreased, leading to a decrease in the overall catalytic efficiency. The findings of this study have also underlined the importance of the choice of pH and buffer during the immobilization process. Overall, this demonstrates that the results are enzyme-specific, and cannot be regarded as reflecting the general behavior of FAEs in MPS.</p>\\n</sec>\\n<back>\\n<app-group>\\n<app id=\"App1\">\\n<sec id=\"Sec31\">\\n<title>Additional file</title>\\n<p id=\"Par70\">\\n<media id=\"MOESM1\" position=\"anchor\" xlink:href=\"12858_2018_91_MOESM1_ESM.docx\"><label>Additional file 1:</label><caption><p>TEM image of the used MPS and stability evaluation of the FAE. <bold>Figure S1.</bold> TEM image of the calcined SBA-15 mesoporous silica material with a 9.9\\xa0nm pore size used in this study. <bold>Figure S2.</bold> pH stability of the enzyme during 24\\xa0h.
